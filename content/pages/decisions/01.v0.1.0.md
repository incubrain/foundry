## Getting Started

This is a **placeholder update**. Replace this content with your own decisions.

### What to Write

Decisions work best when they:

- **Explain decisions** → Why you made specific choices
- **Share learnings** → What worked, what didn't
- **Build trust** → Be transparent about challenges
- **Show progress** → Demonstrate momentum

### Decision Structure

Each decision should include:

- **Label** → Pivot, Learning, Strategic
- **Date** → When the decision was published
- **Title** → Clear, specific headline
- **Summary** → One-sentence overview
- **Content** → Detailed explanation using Markdown

### Markdown Formatting

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- [Links](#) to external resources
- Lists for structured content

## Example Decision Styles

### Strategic Decision

Explain why you chose a specific approach over alternatives.

### Learning Moment

Share mistakes, pivots, or unexpected insights.

## Keep It Real

Your decisions don't need to be perfect. Ship honest, transparent decisions that show your journey. Your audience values authenticity over polish.
