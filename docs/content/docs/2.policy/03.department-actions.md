Dark Sky Conservation requires coordinated, cross-departmental action. The specific actions for each department are detailed in the [Implementation Timeline](#implementation-timeline) below.


## Inter-Departmental Coordination

Dark Sky Conservation success depends on systematic coordination across departments. Three mechanisms ensure effective collaboration:

### 1. Steering Committee
