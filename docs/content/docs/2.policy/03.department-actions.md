::callout{color="info"}
This page outlines department's specific responsibilities, actions, and deliverables for Dark Sky Conservation implementation. Each department has clear accountability across pilot, scaling, and consolidation phases.
::


Dark Sky Conservation requires coordinated, cross-departmental action. The specific actions for each department are detailed in the [Implementation Timeline](#implementation-timeline) below.


## Inter-Departmental Coordination

Dark Sky Conservation requires coordinated action across multiple departments under the oversight of a Steering Committee chaired by the Secretary of Environment & Climate Change Department. For details on committee composition, working groups, and coordination mechanisms, see [Recommendation I: Establish Steering Committee](internal:policy/recommendations#recommendation-i-establish-steering-committee-on-dark-sky-conservation).

## Implementation Timeline

Department-specific actions are organized across three implementation phases: Pilot (2026-2029), Scaling (2029-2035), and Consolidation (2035-2047). See [detailed implementation phases and milestones](internal:pilots).
