title: Regulatory Framework for ALAN Control
description: Proposed ALAN notification structure for Maharashtra, including definitions, scope, controls, enforcement mechanisms, and penalty structures.
---

This page outlines the proposed regulatory framework for [ALAN](term:ALAN) control in Maharashtra. The framework is designed to be issued as a notification under the Maharashtra Environment (Protection) Act, providing legal authority for statewide lighting standards.

::callout{color="info"}
**For Environment Department**: This framework provides the structure for the ALAN notification. It is designed to be legally robust, administratively feasible, and compatible with existing environmental regulations.
::

## Notification Structure Overview

The proposed ALAN notification follows a standard environmental regulation format with seven key sections:

1. **Definitions and Interpretation**
2. **Scope and Applicability**
3. **Lighting Zone Classifications**
4. **Lighting Standards and Controls**
5. **Compliance and Monitoring**
6. **Enforcement and Penalties**
7. **Appeals and Exemptions**

## 1. Definitions and Interpretation

### Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Artificial Light at Night (ALAN)** | Outdoor artificial illumination occurring between sunset and sunrise from human-made sources |
| **Light Pollution** | Excessive, misdirected, or obtrusive artificial light that alters natural light levels in outdoor environments |
| **Sky Glow** | Brightening of the night sky over inhabited areas caused by artificial light scattering in the atmosphere |
| **Light Trespass** | Unwanted light falling on properties or areas where it is not needed or intended |
| **Glare** | Excessive brightness that causes visual discomfort or reduces visibility |
| **Uplight** | Light emitted above the horizontal plane of a luminaire, contributing directly to [sky glow](term:Sky Glow) |
| **Full Cutoff Fixture** | [Lighting fixture](term:Full Cutoff Fixture) designed to emit zero light above 90 degrees from vertical |
| **Shielded Lighting** | Lighting fixtures designed to prevent light emission above the horizontal plane |
| **Correlated Color Temperature (CCT)** | Measure of light color expressed in Kelvin (K), indicating spectral composition |
| **Lighting Curfew** | Time-based restriction requiring dimming or switch-off of non-essential outdoor lighting |
| **Core Dark Area** | Areas requiring highest level of night-sky protection with lighting restricted to essential safety needs |
| **Buffer Area** | Transition areas surrounding Core Dark Areas with controlled lighting intensity, spectrum, shielding, and curfew |
| **Regulated Urban Area** | Built-up areas where lighting is regulated primarily for efficiency, shielding, and spectral control |
| **Lighting Management Plan (LMP)** | Site or area-specific plan defining lighting design, operation, and mitigation measures |
| **Sky Quality Meter (SQM)** | Instrument for measuring night-sky brightness in magnitudes per square arcsecond |
