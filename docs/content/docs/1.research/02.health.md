department_summary: Circadian disruption from artificial light at night is linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and pregnancy complications.
---

## Overview

The human circadian system evolved under natural light-dark cycles. Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) disrupts this fundamental biological rhythm, with cascading health consequences across all life stages, from newborns establishing circadian patterns to elderly populations at elevated dementia risk.

## 1. Economic Burden of Sleep Disruption

  Sleep disruption from ALAN imposes substantial economic costs through healthcare expenses, lost productivity, and obesity-related disease burden globally.

### 1.1 Global Insomnia Costs

  The societal and economic burden of insomnia is substantial.[](cite:hafner-2023-insomnia-burden) The 2023 RAND Europe international study[](cite:hafner-2023-insomnia-burden) quantifies healthcare costs, lost productivity, and reduced quality of life attributable to chronic sleep disruption.

### 1.2 Obesity Epidemic

  The World Obesity Atlas 2023[](cite:who-2023-obesity-atlas) documents global obesity trends, with emerging evidence linking ALAN exposure to metabolic disorders through circadian disruption and melatonin suppression.

## 2. Life-Stage Vulnerabilities

ALAN exposure affects human health differently across developmental stages, from circadian establishment in newborns to accelerated cognitive decline in elderly populations.

### 2.1 Newborns & Infants

Light exposure during critical developmental windows has long-term consequences for circadian rhythm establishment.[](cite:yates-2018-newborn-circadian) The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine study[](cite:yates-2018-newborn-circadian) documents how early-life light exposure patterns program lifelong sleep-wake cycles.

**Maharashtra Context**: Urban areas with high outdoor lighting levels may affect infant circadian development through bedroom light intrusion.

### 2.2 Children & Adolescents

Chronic light cycle disruption during adolescence affects circadian clock development, neuronal activity rhythms, and behavior.[](cite:bonilla-2024-adolescent-circadian) The Frontiers in Neuroscience study[](cite:bonilla-2024-adolescent-circadian) demonstrates lasting impacts on brain function from adolescent ALAN exposure.

### 2.3 Pregnancy

The impact of occupational shift work and working hours during pregnancy on health outcomes is well-documented.[](cite:cai-2019-pregnancy-shift-work) The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology meta-analysis[](cite:cai-2019-pregnancy-shift-work) links maternal circadian disruption to adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Light and circadian signaling pathways in pregnancy program adult health and disease.[](cite:tain-2020-pregnancy-light) Maternal light exposure influences fetal development with transgenerational consequences.

### 2.4 Elderly Populations

Outdoor nighttime light exposure is associated with Alzheimer's disease.[](cite:voigt-2024-alzheimers) The 2024 Frontiers in Neuroscience study[](cite:voigt-2024-alzheimers) links residential ALAN levels to dementia prevalence, suggesting environmental light pollution may contribute to neurodegenerative disease.

Body clocks influence dementia risk,[](cite:aan-2025-dementia-body-clock) with circadian disruption from ALAN potentially accelerating cognitive decline in aging populations.

## 3. Occupational Health: Shift Workers

  Night shift workers face elevated health risks from chronic circadian disruption, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.

### 3.1 Cardiovascular Disease

  Shift work and the risk of cardiovascular disease show a dose-response relationship.[](cite:torquati-2018-shift-cardiovascular) The Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health meta-analysis[](cite:torquati-2018-shift-cardiovascular) quantifies elevated cardiovascular risk among shift workers exposed to nighttime light.

### 3.2 Cancer Risk

  The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies night shift work as "probably carcinogenic to humans."[](cite:iarc-2019-night-shift) IARC Monographs Volume 124[](cite:iarc-2019-night-shift) evaluates evidence linking circadian disruption to cancer risk, particularly breast and prostate cancers.

  **Maharashtra Context**: Industrial and service sectors employ substantial shift work populations in Mumbai, Pune, and manufacturing hubs.

## 4. Mechanisms: Circadian Disruption

ALAN exposure suppresses melatonin production, disrupts circadian rhythms, and affects:
- **Metabolic regulation** (glucose metabolism, appetite hormones)
- **Immune function** (inflammatory responses, infection susceptibility)
- **DNA repair mechanisms** (cancer risk elevation)
- **Neurological function** (cognitive decline, mood disorders)

These mechanisms explain the diverse health outcomes associated with chronic ALAN exposure documented across epidemiological studies.

## 5. Policy Implications

  The UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee's comprehensive report[](cite:uk-parliament-2023-light-noise-health) on artificial light and noise effects on human health provides policy-relevant synthesis of evidence, emphasizing regulatory approaches to mitigate health harms.

---

## 6. Research Gaps

Maharashtra-specific research needs:
1. **Baseline health data**: Urban vs. rural ALAN exposure and disease prevalence
2. **Occupational studies**: Shift worker health outcomes in Maharashtra industries
3. **Pediatric assessments**: Child development and urban light exposure
4. **Elderly populations**: Dementia risk and residential lighting patterns
5. **Economic valuation**: Healthcare costs attributable to ALAN in Maharashtra
