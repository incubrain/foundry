## Overview

Inefficient outdoor lighting represents a triple burden: wasted energy, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions, and exacerbated urban heat island effects. This waste is preventable through improved lighting design, technology adoption, and regulatory frameworks.

## 1. Energy Waste from Outdoor Lighting

  Inefficient outdoor lighting wastes 30-50% of consumed energy globally through over-illumination, poor optical design, and outdated technology.

### 1.1 Global Context

  The International Energy Agency's landmark report "Light's Labour's Lost"[](cite:iea-2006-lights-labour-lost) documents that 30-50% of outdoor lighting energy is wasted through:
  - **Over-illumination** (light levels exceeding functional needs)
  - **Poor optical design** (light directed upward or horizontally)
  - **Inefficient technology** (outdated lamp types, lack of controls)
  - **Operational inefficiency** (lights operating when not needed)

### 1.2 LED Retrofit Efficiency

  Actual energy savings when replacing high-pressure sodium with LED luminaires in street lighting[](cite:djuretic-2018-led-savings) demonstrate 40-60% energy reductions. The Energy journal study[](cite:djuretic-2018-led-savings) provides empirical data on retrofit performance, confirming substantial efficiency gains.

  **Maharashtra Context**: Municipal street lighting energy consumption data needed for state-level waste estimates.

## 2. Climate Change Implications

Outdoor lighting efficiency is recognized as a cost-effective climate action strategy, with India maintaining official emission factors for calculating lighting-related GHG impacts.

### 2.1 UNFCCC Lighting Initiative

The UNFCCC en.lighten initiative[](cite:unfccc-2023-enlighten) promotes energy-efficient lighting as a climate action strategy. The "Momentum for Change" program[](cite:unfccc-2023-enlighten) recognizes lighting efficiency as a cost-effective GHG emissions reduction pathway.

### 2.2 India's Emission Factors

#### National Grid Emissions

The Central Electricity Authority maintains India's CO₂ baseline database for the power sector.[](cite:cea-2023-co2-baseline) These official emission factors are essential for calculating GHG impacts of lighting energy consumption.

#### Updated Emission Factors

The Universal Carbon Registry announces annual updates to India grid emission factors.[](cite:ucr-2025-india-grid-emission) The 2024 vintage[](cite:ucr-2025-india-grid-emission) provides current carbon intensity values for Maharashtra's electricity consumption.

**Maharashtra Context**: Maharashtra's electricity consumption share and grid emission factors determine state-level lighting GHG footprint.

## 3. Urban Heat Island Exacerbation

  Artificial lighting contributes to urban heat through direct heat emission, surface warming, and reduced nighttime cooling, exacerbating climate resilience challenges.

### 3.1 Nighttime Lights and Urban Heat

  NOAA's six-year assessment of major U.S. cities using multi-satellite observations[](cite:noaa-2023-urban-heat) documents the relationship between nighttime lights and urban heat islands. Artificial lighting contributes to urban heat through:
  - **Direct heat emission** from inefficient lamps
  - **Surface warming** from absorbed light energy
  - **Reduced nighttime cooling** in illuminated areas

### 3.2 Climate Resilience Implications

  Urban heat islands exacerbate heat wave mortality, increase cooling energy demand, and worsen air quality. Light pollution reduction offers a co-benefit strategy: simultaneously addressing energy waste, GHG emissions, and urban heat.

## 4. Maharashtra's Climate Commitments

Efficient lighting regulation aligns with Maharashtra's climate action framework:
- **India Net Zero 2070**: National long-term low emission development strategy[](cite:india-2022-net-zero)
- **AMRUT Climate Action Cells**: Urban climate adaptation in Maharashtra cities[](cite:maharashtra-2024-amrut-gr)
- **Under2 Coalition**: Maharashtra's subnational climate commitment[](cite:maharashtra-under2-coalition)

Dark Sky Conservation offers a "quick win" for Maharashtra's climate targets—proven technology, immediate energy savings, and measurable GHG reductions.

## 5. Policy Integration Opportunities

### 5.1 Energy Efficiency Standards

  Lighting regulation can integrate with:
  - Energy Conservation Building Codes
  - Municipal energy efficiency targets
  - Renewable energy transition planning
  - Smart city infrastructure development

### 5.2 Carbon Accounting

  Outdoor lighting GHG emissions should be:
  - Included in municipal carbon inventories
  - Tracked in sectoral emission reporting
  - Targeted in climate action plans
  - Monitored for reduction progress

## 6. Research Gaps

Maharashtra-specific research needs:
1. **Energy baseline**: Outdoor lighting consumption by sector and municipality
2. **Efficiency potential**: LED retrofit opportunity assessment
3. **GHG quantification**: State-level emissions from outdoor lighting
4. **Urban heat mapping**: Nighttime light and temperature correlation
5. **Co-benefits analysis**: Integrated climate, energy, and biodiversity outcomes
