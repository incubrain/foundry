## The ALAN Problem

[Artificial Light at Night](term:ALAN) (ALAN) represents one of the most rapidly growing forms of environmental pollution. Global night sky brightness is increasing 9.6% annually,[](cite:kyba-2023-globe-at-night) with over 80% of the world's population living under light-polluted skies.[](cite:falchi-2016-world-atlas) This pervasive [light pollution](term:light pollution) affects ecosystems, human health, climate systems, and economic productivity.

## Impact Domains: Quick Reference

| Impact Domain | Key Finding | Relevant Departments | Citations |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Ecology & Biodiversity** | Light pollution disrupts nocturnal ecosystems,[](cite:holker-2010-biodiversity-threat) affecting pollination, bird migration, and marine life | Environment, Forest, Agriculture, Fisheries | 11 studies |
| **Human Health** | Circadian disruption linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and dementia,[](cite:uk-parliament-2023-light-noise-health) with significant economic burden from insomnia alone[](cite:hafner-2023-insomnia-burden) | Public Health, Medical Education | 11 studies |
| **Climate & Energy** | 30-50% of outdoor lighting energy is wasted[](cite:iea-2006-lights-labour-lost) through poor design, contributing to GHG emissions and urban heat islands[](cite:noaa-2023-urban-heat) | Energy, Environment (Climate Cell), Urban Development | 6 studies |
| **Tourism & Economy** | Dark sky tourism market growth projected,[](cite:futuredata-2025-darksky-market) with proven ROI from certified sites in Utah, UK, and South Africa[](cite:mitchell-2019-colorado-plateau) | Tourism, Finance, Revenue | 6 studies |
