::callout{color="info"}
This section provides the scientific justification for Dark Sky Conservation policy. Each impact domain presents peer-reviewed evidence relevant to departmental mandates.

## The ALAN Problem

::tip
**Scale of the Problem**: Global night sky brightness is increasing 9.6% annually,[](cite:kyba-2023-star-loss) with 93.9% of India's population living under light-polluted skies.[](cite:falchi-2016-world-atlas)

[Artificial Light at Night](term:alan) (ALAN) represents one of the most rapidly growing forms of environmental pollution. Global night sky brightness is increasing 9.6% annually, with over 80% of the world's population—and specifically 93.9% of India's population—living under light-polluted skies.[](cite:falchi-2016-world-atlas) This pervasive [light pollution](term:light-pollution) affects ecosystems, human health, climate systems, and economic productivity.

## Research Structure

This section presents peer-reviewed scientific evidence across four impact domains. Each page provides:
- **Citation-dense documentation** for academic rigor
- **Global evidence base** with Maharashtra context in callout boxes
- **Quantified impacts** from international studies
- **Tables and data summaries** for rapid reference
