## Risk Management

**Risk**: Pilot sites demonstrate policy is not feasible
**Mitigation**: Adaptive management through [policy feedback loop](internal:pilots/policy-feedback-loop); alternative approaches tested; if fundamentally infeasible, policy redesigned before scaling

**Risk**: Statewide scaling faces budget constraints
**Mitigation**: Phase II budget phased over 6 years; energy savings create self-financing mechanism; prioritize high-impact zones first

**Risk**: Compliance rates lower than expected
**Mitigation**: Grace periods, technical assistance, subsidies for economically disadvantaged; strengthen enforcement capacity; stakeholder engagement campaigns

**Risk**: Political transitions disrupt implementation
**Mitigation**: Multi-party Steering Committee; embed in statutory framework (Environment Act notification); demonstrate early wins (tourism revenue, energy savings) building political support

## From Pilots to Permanence

This 21-year pathway transforms Dark Sky Conservation from experimental policy to permanent governance infrastructure. By 2047, future generations of Maharashtrians will inherit a protected night sky—a recoverable public asset safeguarded through evidence-based, phased, and politically sustainable implementation.
