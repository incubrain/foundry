## Site-Level Implementation Teams

Each pilot site has a dedicated implementation team:

**Team Composition** (varies by zone type):
- Site coordinator (municipal engineer, Protected Area officer, gram panchayat representative)
- Lighting technician
- Community liaison
- AstronEra site monitor
- Stakeholder representatives (2-3 community members)

**Responsibilities**:
- Implement lighting changes per approved plans
- Conduct baseline and ongoing data collection
- Engage local stakeholders
- Report monthly to Technical Secretariat
- Document challenges and solutions

## Inter-Agency Coordination Mechanisms

**Quarterly Coordination Meetings**: Working group chairs brief Steering Committee

**Rapid Response Protocol**: Critical issues (safety incidents, legal challenges) trigger immediate cross-department coordination

**Knowledge Management**: Shared online platform for documenting lessons learned, sharing solutions across sites

## Budget and Resources

**Pilot Phase Budget (2026-2029)**: ₹25 crore
- Site implementation: ₹15 crore
- Monitoring and evaluation: ₹5 crore
- Technical Secretariat: ₹3 crore
- Capacity building: ₹2 crore

**Funding Sources**:
- State budget allocation (Environment Department)
- [AMRUT](term:amrut) city funds for urban pilot sites[](cite:maharashtra-2024-amrut-gr)
- Tourism Department for astrotourism development
- Potential co-financing from national schemes (CAMPA, climate funds)

## Decision-Making Authority

**Steering Committee**: Policy-level decisions, budget approvals, notification amendments

**Technical Working Groups**: Technical recommendations (non-binding advice)

**Technical Secretariat**: Operational decisions within approved frameworks (e.g., data collection protocols)

**Site Implementation Teams**: Local implementation decisions (fixture selection within standards)

**Final Authority**: All policy decisions subject to Cabinet approval; Steering Committee recommendations advisory

## From Pilots to Permanent Governance (Post-2029)

Upon statewide scaling, institutional framework evolves:

**Steering Committee**: Continues as permanent oversight body for Dark Sky Conservation policy

**Technical Secretariat**: Long-term role supporting certification, monitoring, capacity building

**Working Groups**: Expand to include additional expertise as policy matures

**District-Level Teams**: Site teams model scales to district-level implementation teams across Maharashtra

The institutional framework ensures that Dark Sky Conservation policy has permanent governance structures, not ad-hoc arrangements.
