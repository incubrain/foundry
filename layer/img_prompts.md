Understood. Let’s strip the base prompts down to purely **aesthetic DNA**—the texture, lighting logic, and brushwork—leaving the specific Maharashtrian subjects and locations for the individual prompts.

### The Simplified Base Prompts

**Base 1 [Pristine Style]**

> **Base 1:** Impressionist Realism, soft painterly style with refined, elegant brush strokes. High-contrast lighting with deep, saturated cool tones. Focus on clarity, vastness, and celestial brilliance. Foreground details are rendered in soft, natural shadows.

**Base 2 [Polluted Style]**

> **Base 2:** Impressionist Realism, soft painterly style with heavy, textured brush strokes. Low-contrast, hazy atmosphere with a washed-out, murky color palette. Focus on atmospheric weight, visual obstruction, and invasive artificial glows.

Impressionist Realism, soft painterly style with heavy, textured brush strokes. Low-contrast, hazy atmosphere with a washed-out, murky color palette. Focus on atmospheric weight, visual obstruction, and invasive artificial glows. 
A rhythmic pattern of rural homes where every window glows with a restless, flickering blue light from screens or LEDs. The atmosphere feels wakeful and humming, suppressed by a murky sky-glow.

#### 11. Energy Waste and Emissions

**Aspect Ratio: 16:9**
Impressionist Realism, soft painterly style with heavy, textured brush strokes. Low-contrast, hazy atmosphere with a washed-out, murky color palette. Focus on atmospheric weight, visual obstruction, and invasive artificial glows. 
Industrial silhouettes of an MIDC zone. Massive amounts of light are directed upward into the atmosphere, reflecting off a quiet river. The sky is a heavy, polluted indigo-grey with zero stars visible.
