## **Preface**

Light pollution is operationally defined as 'the human-made alteration of outdoor light levels from those occurring naturally'. Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) is no longer a peripheral environmental concern; it is a scientifically established pollutant with direct and compounding consequences for public health, biodiversity, climate resilience, infrastructure efficiency, and long-term state expenditure [\[1\]](https://darksky.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ALAN-State-of-the-Science-2025-EN-2.pdf). 

Maharashtra’s rapid urbanisation and infrastructure expansion currently proceed in the absence of any statutory or regulatory framework governing ALAN, creating avoidable ecological damage, fiscal inefficiency, and legal exposure under binding national law and obligations arising from international commitments. 

Global experience across more than forty jurisdictions demonstrates that ALAN regulation is administratively viable, legally robust, and economically accretive, delivering substantial energy savings, measurable revenue through dark-sky-led tourism, and durable protection of high-value ecological and cultural assets. 

This document consolidates the evidence base, legal precedent, and fiscal rationale for action; defines clear department-specific policy measures within existing mandates; and presents a phased implementation pathway that manages risk while delivering early returns.

The administrative decision required at this stage is focused and executable: constitute a cross-departmental steering committee, issue interim dark-sky lighting guidelines under existing environmental authority, and integrate dark-sky conservation into the Tourism Policy framework.

These steps enable Maharashtra to meet its legal obligations, prevent irreversible loss, and exercise national leadership in sustainable lighting governance, transforming the night from an unmanaged liability into a protected public asset.

## **Widespread Harm From Unregulated Light** {#widespread-harm-from-unregulated-light}

Global night sky brightness is increasing 9.6% annually \[[2](%20https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abq7781)\], with 93.9% of India's population living under light-polluted skies \[[3](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1600377)\]. **Maharashtra has no legal framework to address ALAN**. The evidence below establishes the scope and scale of impact, providing the evidentiary foundation for regulatory intervention and fiscal prioritisation.

| Domain | ALAN's Impact |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Economic** | • Energy: $50B annually on light escaping to space, 30-70% savings achievable \[[4](https://www.iea.org/reports/lights-labours-lost),[5](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.05.179)\]• Healthcare: Up to £34B/year sleep disturbance (UK)    Projected $4.32T global obesity burden by 2035 \[[6](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7256/the-effects-of-artificial-light-and-noise-on-human-health),[7](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2166-1.html),[8](https://www.worldobesity.org/resources/resource-library/world-obesity-atlas-2023)\]• Agricultural: 62% nocturnal pollination reduction, up to $729B projected global loss \[[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature23288),[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800925000485)\]• Tourism: Global dark sky market $1B (2025) → $3B (2032) with growth trend \[[11](https://www.futuredatastats.com/dark-sky-stargazing-tours-market)\] |

These impacts compound over time and across systems. Maharashtra's current regulatory gap exposes the State to ongoing fiscal leakage, preventable health burdens, and ecosystem degradation with irreversible thresholds. The global policy frameworks that follow demonstrate proven administrative pathways to abate these costs while generating positive economic returns.

## **Established Global Legal Frameworks** {#established-global-legal-frameworks}

ALAN regulation is an established global practice. Over forty countries across five continents have formally recognised ALAN in law and implemented enforceable controls through planning, environmental, and sectoral frameworks. In parallel, more than 250 regulated dark-sky sites operating across multiple jurisdictions demonstrate that such controls are practical, scalable, and routine. 

Relevant approaches that can be adapted to Maharashtra’s regulatory and governance framework.

| Country | Legal Status | Controls / Enforcement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

These precedents eliminate implementation risk. Maharashtra can adopt tested frameworks, adapt proven standards, and leverage two decades of international regulatory experience. Beyond compliance, these frameworks demonstrate low-risk, high-return governance intervention.

## **Observed Economic Returns** {#observed-economic-returns}

Dark sky policy delivers quantifiable returns through tourism revenue, energy efficiency, and long-term asset protection. Conservative projections from comparable sites establish the fiscal basis for investment. 

The table below consolidates real-world outcomes that demonstrate regulation improves fiscal performance rather than burdening it.

| Country | Impact Category | Key Metric |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **USA** *Utah* | Revenue Multiplier | $5.8B revenue over 10 years (Colorado Plateau) 10,000+ jobs annually \[[52](%20https://www.nmdarksky.org/economicimpact/ColoradoPlateauEconomicImpact.pdf)\] |
| **UK** *Northumberland* | Revenue Multiplier | £25M annual revenue from dark sky tourism450 direct jobs supported£1.93 ROI per £1 spent on dark sky-friendly lighting \[[53](https://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Report-2-Appendix-1-202324-Performance-report.pdf),[54](%20https://www.visitnorthumberland.org.uk/research-insights/regional-national/tourism-economic-impact-report)\] |
| **South Africa** | Revenue Multiplier | 10% annual growth target for rural astro-tourism by 2030 \[[55](https://www.tourism.gov.za/CurrentProjects/National_Astro_Tourism_Strategy/Documents/National%20Astro%20Tourism%20Strategy%20August%202023.pdf)\] |
| **DSI Certified Sites** *Global* | Revenue Multiplier | 30-40% increase in tourist footfall post-Dark Sky Place certification \[[56](%20https://darksky.org/news/international-dark-sky-places-program-advocacy-2024/)\] |
| **France** | Efficiency Dividend | €200M+ annual savings via midnight curfews (2 TWh energy, 250K tons CO2 reduced) \[[57](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000037864346),[58](https://darksky.org/news/france-light-pollution-law-2018/)\] |
| **Chile** | Asset Preservation | $2B+ astronomical infrastructure protected (30-year utility) \[[59](https://www.epingalert.org/en/DOL/GetDocument?dolLink=G/TBTN24/CHL677&notificationId=91894),[60](https://giantmagellan.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SPIE22.pdf)\] |
| **UK/Ireland** | Asset Preservation | Heritage nightscape preservation (Kerry Reserve, statutory nuisance protections) \[[61](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/16/section/102)\] |

These returns scale with ambition. Maharashtra's ALAN regulation would position the state to capture tourism multipliers, realise immediate energy savings, and protect assets with multi-decadal utility. 

## 

## **Department-Specific Actions** {#department-specific-actions}

Effective regulation of ALAN requires coordinated, cross-departmental action, with each department addressing distinct but interconnected aspects of governance. 

The measures below assign clear responsibility, define actionable scope, and link interventions to proven international precedents, enabling parallel implementation without legislative dependency.

| Policy Area / Department | Actions |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Legal & Regulatory***Environment & Climate Change* | • Notify ALAN under the Environment Act, 1986• Adopt DarkSky lighting principles• Enable compliance, enforcement, and penalties  |
| **Zoning & Technical***Urban Development* | • Classify Core Dark, Buffer, and Regulated Urban Areas • Mandate lighting principles in Urban, Rural, Forest, Tourism, and Coastal Zones  |
| **Environmental***Forest* | • Integrate ALAN into EIAs and project appraisals • Strict controls in forests, wetlands, coasts, and wildlife corridors  |
| **Cultural & Community***Tribal Development* | • Document and promote traditional sky knowledge• Support community-led stargazing and outreach• Issue culturally sensitive lighting guidelines |
| **Economic & Tourism***Tourism* | • Pursue International Dark Sky Place certifications• Develop dark-sky tourism circuits• Link conservation with tribal/rural income generation |
| **Energy & Climate***Energy* | • Statewide public dark-sky-compliant lighting retrofits• Track energy and carbon savings  |
| **Institutional Coordination***Environment & Climate Change* | • Establish an inter-departmental committee• Fund training, awareness campaigns, and research • Monitor compliance and outcomes  |

By grounding action in this framework, the State is positioned to meet its regulatory and climate commitments while leveraging proven global practices.

## **Obligations and Alignment** {#obligations-and-alignment}

Maharashtra’s current approach to ALAN lacks regulatory oversight, leaving it unaddressed despite enforceable national/international commitments and climate/sustainability objectives. 

**Table 1: ALAN obligations under national and international frameworks**

| Framework | Obligation | Alignment |

These obligations and objectives carry legal, financial, and institutional significance. The distinction between binding compliance (Table 1\) and strategic alignment (Table 2\) clarifies immediate regulatory responsibilities versus longer-term leadership, forming the foundation for coordinated, phased implementation.

## 

## **Three-Phase Implementation Pathway** {#three-phase-implementation-pathway}

This pathway sequences actions across pilot validation (2026–2029), statewide scaling (2029–2035), and consolidation phases (2035–2047), managing implementation risk while establishing early proof points for administrative and fiscal performance.

| Phase | Objective | Critical Milestones |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **I: Pilot** *2026* | Pilot sites feed policy creation | • Broader Guidelines for Dark Sky Policy *(Environment Department)* • Constitute an inter-departmental steering committee • Amend Tourism policy to include dark sky conservation through astrotourism • Launch DSI Certified pilot projects |
| **I: Pilot***2027* | Findings guide policy amendments | • Finalise area classifications (core, buffer, urban) • Notify ALAN under Environment Act |
| **I: Pilot***2028/29* | Pilots drive standardisation | • Capacity-building for all stakeholders • Track ecological, energy, health, and economic outcomes |
| ***II: Scaling** 2029-35* | Statewide rollout and monitoring | • Expand to urban, rural, forest, tourism, and coastal zones • Strengthen enforcement and monitoring systems • Integrate ALAN into EIA processes  • Statewide public dark-sky-compliant lighting retrofits |
| ***III: Consolidation** 2035-47* | Maharashtra shapes National ALAN Policy | • Monitor statewide compliance and outcomes • Track statewide energy and carbon savings |

This phased structure enables risk-managed deployment with defined decision gates. Pilot phase delivers certification-driven revenue and technical validation by 2029; scaling phase operationalises statewide compliance and energy savings by 2035; consolidation phase positions Maharashtra as a national reference model. The pathway delivers early returns while building institutional capacity systematically.

## **AstronEra as Technical Secretariat** {#astronera-as-technical-secretariat}

International experience demonstrates that successful ALAN governance depends on a dedicated entity capable of standards interpretation, inter-departmental coordination, scientific dataset management, and long-term certification oversight.

AstronEra (AEII Pvt. Ltd.), led by Ms. Shweta Kulkarni (FRAS), has been operating at this intersection of policy, science, and implementation within India’s governance context. Ms. Kulkarni's recognition as Dark Sky Defender (Asia 2024\) was acknowledged by the Honourable Chief Minister of Maharashtra in his National Space Day (23rd August 2025\) announcement of the forthcoming Dark Sky Policy.

With guidance from MITRA, AstronEra has supported the identification of eleven pilot dark-sky sites across the State and has already been appointed as the Technical Secretariat for DarkSky Certification in multiple districts. This positions AstronEra to support the State as a neutral, technically competent partner for coordinated policy execution.

* Only Indian entity with a direct, formal relationship with DarkSky International \[[73](https://astronera.org/doi/dsi-acknowledgement)\]  
* Member of the DSI working group updating Dark Sky Places guidelines  
* Organised DST-funded international Conference on dark sky preservation and astrotourism \[[74](https://astronera.org/doi/idspac-2023)\]  
* AstroGuide Training Project funded by the IAU’s Office of Astronomy development \[[75](https://astro4dev.org/guide-training-workshop-for-tribal-students/),[76](https://astro4dev.org/guide-training-for-the-tribal-students/)\]  
* Published a scientific report on the dark sky policy roadmap for Maharashtra \[[77](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15860666)\]  
* 15+ years building global network and outreach

**Scope**

* Act as technical secretariat for the Steering Committee  
* Research, analyse, and contextualise global dark sky conservation and astrotourism models to inform state-level policy design, guidelines, and regulatory frameworks.  
* Act as a liaison between DSI, international experts and the Government  
* Coordinate Dark Sky Place certification and long-term sustainability within India   
* Cultivate localised AstroGuides and technical capacity  
* Establish and process night-sky quality, light pollution, and ecological impact datasets  
* Technical liaison between research institutions, universities, and government departments  
* Translate scientific findings into policy briefs, technical notes, and public-facing content

AstronEra partner capacity to government will align policy expertise, interdepartmental coordination, international certification pathways, global recognition, and localised implementation experience to support dark-sky governance at the State level.

*DarkSky International (DSI) is a United States–based, non-governmental, non-profit organisation that functions as a global technical and standards reference body for responsible outdoor lighting and night-sky protection. Its role in this framework is limited to providing internationally recognised technical criteria, certification protocols, and best-practice guidance. Engagement with DSI does not entail policy delegation, regulatory authority, or funding dependency; all policy decisions, enforcement powers, and institutional control remain exclusively with the Government of Maharashtra.*

* Experiential offerings: Astronomical events, observations and tours  
* Revenue generation model through programs such as astroguide training and homestays  
* Astrotourism circuit connecting certified Dark Sky Places across the state

**IV. Commission Detailed Policy Research and Drafting**  
This document outlines the proposed dark-sky policy framework. Further commissioned research, technical studies, and consultations will be required to generate the evidence base, implementation tools, and draft regulatory inputs necessary for policy formulation.

These actions are required to establish legal, technical, and operational structure. They can be executed within existing departmental authority, deliver measurable outputs, and position Maharashtra to capture first-mover advantage in India, while meeting binding environmental compliance requirements.

## **Dark Skies: A Right, Not A Privilege** {#dark-skies:-a-right,-not-a-privilege}

The night sky is not a lost heritage; it is a recoverable public asset. With focused executive action, Maharashtra transforms lighting from an unmanaged liability into a governed resource, meeting legal obligations while capturing economic opportunity. The state that acts first establishes the regulatory standard, captures the tourism market, and positions itself as India's reference model for sustainable governance. **The decision point is now.**
