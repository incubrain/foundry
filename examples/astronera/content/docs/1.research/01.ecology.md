::callout{color="info"}
Light pollution is now recognized as a significant biodiversity threat with cascading effects on ecosystems, agricultural productivity, and marine life.
::

## Overview

:cited[Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) fundamentally rewires nocturnal ecosystems]{#sanders-2021-meta-analysis}, disrupting behaviors evolved over millions of years in darkness. The impacts span from individual organism physiology to ecosystem-level functions, with economic consequences for agriculture and fisheries.

## 1. Biodiversity Disruption

### 1.1 Ecosystem-Level Effects

::tip
  **Key Statistics**: :cited[60% of invertebrates and 30% of vertebrates are nocturnal]{#holker-2010-biodiversity-threat}, while :cited[83% of Earth's land surface is affected by light pollution]{#falchi-2016-world-atlas}.
::

  :cited[Light pollution is now recognized as a major biodiversity threat, comparable to habitat loss and climate change in its scope]{#holker-2010-biodiversity-threat}. A :cited[comprehensive meta-analysis of biological impacts]{#sanders-2021-meta-analysis} documents disruption across taxa, trophic levels, and geographic regions.

  Recent research shows :cited[ALAN directly affects ecosystem functions]{#heinen-2025-ecosystem-functions} such as predation, herbivory, and decomposition. Even low-intensity artificial light alters predator-prey dynamics in urban environments, with cascading effects through food webs.

  **Maharashtra Context**: The Central Asian Flyway passes through Maharashtra, with protected areas in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot facing light intrusion.
::

### 1.2 Avian Mortality

  Bird-building collisions represent a catastrophic and largely preventable source of mortality. :cited[Over one billion birds die annually in the U.S. alone]{#abc-2024-bird-collisions} from building strikes, primarily during nocturnal migration when artificial light disorients birds.

  :cited[Rehabilitation outcomes are poor]{#kornreich-2024-bird-rehab}, with most collision victims dying even with veterinary intervention. Prevention through lighting regulation is therefore critical.

### 1.3 Insect Population Collapse

  Nocturnal insects, which comprise over 60% of insect biomass, face dire consequences from ALAN. :cited[The comprehensive review by Owens & Lewis]{#owens-2018-nocturnal-insects} documents:
  - **Fatal attraction** to light sources (moths, beetles, flies)
  - **Disrupted mating** through light interference with bioluminescent signals (fireflies)
  - **Altered development** from light exposure during immature stages
  - **Reduced survival** due to increased predation near lights

## 2. Agricultural Impacts

Light pollution disrupts agricultural systems through nocturnal pollination collapse and livestock circadian rhythms, with cascading economic consequences for crop yields and dairy production.

### 2.1 Nocturnal Pollination Collapse

::tip
**Key Statistics**: :cited[Light pollution causes 62% reduction in nocturnal pollination activity]{#knop-2017-pollination-threat}, with :cited[projected global losses of up to \$729 billion in pollinator-dependent crops]{#feuerbacher-2025-pollinator-decline}.
::

Light pollution represents a new threat to pollination, disrupting the 30% of crops that depend on nocturnal pollinators (moths, beetles, bats). :cited[The Nature study by Knop et al.]{#knop-2017-pollination-threat} documented:
- **62% reduction** in nocturnal pollinator visits to artificially lit plants
- **13% reduction** in fruit production in lit areas
- **Ecosystem-wide effects** beyond directly illuminated zones

### 2.2 Food Security Implications

Pollinator declines threaten global food security, with disproportionate impacts on nutrition (fruits, vegetables, nuts) and developing economies. :cited[The 2025 Ecological Economics study]{#feuerbacher-2025-pollinator-decline} projects:
- **\$160-191 billion annual loss** in global food production value (conservative estimate)
- **Up to \$729 billion** in projected global losses when accounting for crop diversity and regional dependencies
- **Nutritional impacts** exceeding caloric impacts
- **Trade disruptions** as pollinator-dependent crops become scarce

::callout{color="info"}
**Maharashtra Context**: As a major producer of fruits (mangoes, grapes), vegetables (tomatoes, onions), and oilseeds, Maharashtra's agricultural economy is exposed to pollinator decline risks.
::

### 2.3 Livestock & Dairy Sector

:cited[LED lighting in dairy operations]{#pranavi-2025-led-dairy} affects milk production, animal behavior, and welfare. While controlled lighting can optimize productivity, unregulated outdoor ALAN disrupts:
- **Circadian rhythms** in cattle, reducing milk yield
- **Grazing patterns** and nighttime rest
- **Reproductive cycles** through melatonin suppression

## 3. Marine & Coastal Impacts

  Coastal lighting disrupts marine turtle navigation and fish spawning cycles, threatening both biodiversity conservation and commercial fisheries along Maharashtra's 720 km coastline.

### 3.1 India's Policy Framework

  Maharashtra's 720 km coastline is governed by the :cited[Coastal Regulation Zone Notification 2019]{#india-2019-crz-notification} and :cited[National Marine Action Plan]{#india-marine-action-plan}. Both frameworks implicitly require coastal lighting management to protect marine ecosystems.

### 3.2 Marine Turtle Disorientation

  Artificial lighting on beaches is the leading anthropogenic cause of hatchling mortality for marine turtles. Newly emerged hatchlings navigate toward the ocean using light cues (bright horizon over dark land). Beach lighting reverses this gradient, luring hatchlings inland where they die from dehydration, predation, or vehicle strikes.

::callout{color="info"}
  **Maharashtra Context**: Olive ridley turtles nest on Maharashtra beaches (Velas, Anjarle, Dabhol), requiring strict lighting control during nesting season (February-May).
::

### 3.3 Fisheries Impacts

  Coastal ALAN disrupts:
  - **Fish spawning** (many species spawn during specific lunar phases)
  - **Larval development** (light pollution interferes with vertical migration)
  - **Predator-prey dynamics** in nearshore waters
  - **Commercial fishing** (artificially altered fish behavior)

## 4. Research Gaps

Maharashtra-specific research is needed:
1. **Baseline surveys**: Sky quality measurements across ecosystem types
2. **Species monitoring**: Camera trap networks documenting behavior changes
3. **Agricultural assessments**: Pollinator abundance and crop yield correlations
4. **Marine ecology**: Turtle nesting success at Konkan sites
5. **Economic valuation**: Ecosystem service losses from ALAN
