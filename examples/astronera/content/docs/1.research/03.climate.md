::callout{color="info"}
30-50% of outdoor lighting energy is wasted through poor design, contributing to GHG emissions and climate change.
::

## Overview

Inefficient outdoor lighting represents a triple burden: wasted energy, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions, and exacerbated urban heat island effects. This waste is preventable through improved lighting design, technology adoption, and regulatory frameworks.

---

## 1. Energy Waste from Outdoor Lighting

  Inefficient outdoor lighting wastes 30-50% of consumed energy globally through over-illumination, poor optical design, and outdated technology.

### 1.1 Global Context

::tip
**Key Statistics**: :cite[\$50 billion is wasted annually on light escaping to space globally]{#iea-2006-lights-labour-lost}, with 30-70% energy savings achievable through improved lighting design and controls.
::

:cite[The International Energy Agency's landmark report "Light's Labour's Lost"]{#iea-2006-lights-labour-lost} documents that 30-50% of outdoor lighting energy is wasted through:
  - **Over-illumination** (light levels exceeding functional needs)
  - **Poor optical design** (light directed upward or horizontally)
  - **Inefficient technology** (outdated lamp types, lack of controls)
  - **Operational inefficiency** (lights operating when not needed)

### 1.2 LED Retrofit Efficiency

  Actual energy savings when replacing high-pressure sodium with LED luminaires in street lighting demonstrate 40-60% energy reductions. :cite[The Energy journal study]{#djuretic-2018-led-savings} provides empirical data on retrofit performance, confirming substantial efficiency gains.

  **Maharashtra Context**: Municipal street lighting energy consumption data needed for state-level waste estimates.

## 2. Climate Change Implications

Outdoor lighting efficiency is recognized as a cost-effective climate action strategy, with India maintaining official emission factors for calculating lighting-related GHG impacts.

### 2.1 UNFCCC Lighting Initiative

::tip
**Key Statistic**: :cite[Outdoor lighting contributes approximately 5% of global GHG emissions (~2.5 billion tons $\text{CO}_2$e annually)]{#unfccc-2023-enlighten}.
::

The UNFCCC en.lighten initiative promotes energy-efficient lighting as a climate action strategy. :cite[The "Momentum for Change" program]{#unfccc-2023-enlighten} recognizes lighting efficiency as a cost-effective GHG emissions reduction pathway, with outdoor lighting contributing approximately 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

### 2.2 India's Emission Factors

#### National Grid Emissions

:cite[The Central Electricity Authority maintains India's $\text{CO}_2$ baseline database for the power sector]{#cea-2023-co2-baseline}. These official emission factors are essential for calculating GHG impacts of lighting energy consumption.

#### Updated Emission Factors

The Universal Carbon Registry announces annual updates to India grid emission factors. :cite[The 2024 vintage]{#ucr-2025-india-grid-emission} provides current carbon intensity values for Maharashtra's electricity consumption.

### 2.3 Maharashtra Climate Impact

::tip
**Maharashtra-Specific Estimates**:
- **Baseline emissions**: ~20-25 million tons $\text{CO}_2$/year from outdoor lighting (based on Maharashtra's electricity consumption share and :cite[combined margin grid factor of $0.757\,\text{tCO}_2/\text{MWh}$ for FY 2023-24]{#cea-2023-co2-baseline})
- **Reduction potential**: 1.7-4.7 million tons $\text{CO}_2$/year achievable with comprehensive dark sky policy (60-70% efficiency gains on targeted outdoor lighting sectors)
::

Maharashtra's outdoor lighting carbon footprint can be estimated using:
- State electricity consumption patterns (municipal, commercial, industrial outdoor lighting)
- Official grid emission factors from :cite[Central Electricity Authority]{#cea-2023-co2-baseline}
- Typical outdoor lighting share of total electricity demand
- :cite[Combined margin factor ($0.757\,\text{tCO}_2/\text{MWh}$) for FY 2023-24]{#ucr-2025-india-grid-emission}

Based on these factors, Maharashtra's outdoor lighting sector generates an estimated **20-25 million tons of $\text{CO}_2$ equivalent annually**. Comprehensive dark sky regulation targeting efficiency improvements (shielding, CCT control, curfews, retrofits) could reduce emissions by **1.7-4.7 million tons $\text{CO}_2$/year**, contributing meaningfully to state climate targets.

## 3. Urban Heat Island Exacerbation

  Artificial lighting contributes to urban heat through direct heat emission, surface warming, and reduced nighttime cooling, exacerbating climate resilience challenges.

### 3.1 Nighttime Lights and Urban Heat

  :cite[NOAA's six-year assessment of major U.S. cities using multi-satellite observations]{#noaa-2023-urban-heat} documents the relationship between nighttime lights and urban heat islands. Artificial lighting contributes to urban heat through:
  - **Direct heat emission** from inefficient lamps
  - **Surface warming** from absorbed light energy
  - **Reduced nighttime cooling** in illuminated areas

### 3.2 Climate Resilience Implications

  Urban heat islands exacerbate heat wave mortality, increase cooling energy demand, and worsen air quality. Light pollution reduction offers a co-benefit strategy: simultaneously addressing energy waste, GHG emissions, and urban heat.

## 4. Maharashtra's Climate Commitments

Efficient lighting regulation aligns with Maharashtra's climate action framework:
- **India Net Zero 2070**: :cite[National long-term low emission development strategy]{#india-2022-net-zero}
- **AMRUT Climate Action Cells**: :cite[Urban climate adaptation in Maharashtra cities]{#maharashtra-2024-amrut-gr}
- **Under2 Coalition**: :cite[Maharashtra's subnational climate commitment]{#maharashtra-under2-coalition}

::callout{color="success"}
Dark Sky Conservation offers a "quick win" for Maharashtra's climate targets—proven technology, immediate energy savings, and measurable GHG reductions.

## 5. Policy Integration Opportunities

### 5.1 Energy Efficiency Standards

  Lighting regulation can integrate with:
  - Energy Conservation Building Codes
  - Municipal energy efficiency targets
  - Renewable energy transition planning
  - Smart city infrastructure development

### 5.2 Carbon Accounting

  Outdoor lighting GHG emissions should be:
  - Included in municipal carbon inventories
  - Tracked in sectoral emission reporting
  - Targeted in climate action plans
  - Monitored for reduction progress

## 6. Research Gaps

Maharashtra-specific research needs:
1. **Energy baseline**: Outdoor lighting consumption by sector and municipality
2. **Efficiency potential**: LED retrofit opportunity assessment
3. **GHG quantification**: State-level emissions from outdoor lighting
4. **Urban heat mapping**: Nighttime light and temperature correlation
5. **Co-benefits analysis**: Integrated climate, energy, and biodiversity outcomes
