Phased approach manages risk through pilot validation (2026-2029), statewide scaling (2029-2035), and consolidation (2035-2047), delivering early returns while building institutional capacity.

Maharashtra's Dark Sky Conservation policy follows a three-phase implementation pathway that :cited[validates standards through pilot sites before scaling statewide]{#kulkarni-2025-policy-roadmap}.

## Pilot-Informed Approach

Global experience demonstrates that successful :defn[ALAN]{#alan} :cited[regulation requires evidence-based design]{#cms-2024-light-guidelines}. Maharashtra adopts a pilot-first approach where eleven designated sites will test and refine policy frameworks before statewide deployment.

The pilot program serves three critical functions:

1. **Technical Validation**: Demonstrate that :defn[DarkSky International]{#dsi} lighting standards are feasible in Maharashtra's diverse contexts
2. **Evidence Generation**: Track outcomes across ecological, energy, health, and economic domains to justify scaling investment
3. **Policy Refinement**: Incorporate pilot learnings into final [ALAN notification](internal:policy/regulatory-framework) before 2029 statewide rollout

## Three-Phase Implementation Pathway

| Phase | Period | Objective | Critical Milestones |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Phase I: Pilot** | 2026-2029 | Validate policy through pilot sites | • Broader Guidelines for Dark Sky Policy<br>• Constitute inter-departmental steering committee<br>• Amend Tourism Policy to include dark sky conservation<br>• Launch :defn[DSI]{#dsi} certified pilot projects |
| **Phase I: Pilot** | 2027 | Refine based on findings | • Finalize area classifications (core, buffer, urban)<br>• Notify ALAN under Environment Act |
| **Phase I: Pilot** | 2028-2029 | Generate evidence for scaling | • Capacity-building for all stakeholders<br>• Track ecological, energy, health, and economic outcomes |
| **Phase II: Scaling** | 2029-2035 | Statewide rollout | • Expand to urban, rural, forest, tourism, and coastal zones<br>• Strengthen enforcement and monitoring systems<br>• Integrate ALAN into :defn[EIA]{#eia} processes<br>• Statewide public dark-sky-compliant lighting retrofits |
| **Phase III: Consolidation** | 2035-2047 | National leadership | • Monitor statewide compliance and outcomes<br>• Track statewide energy and carbon savings<br>• Position Maharashtra as national reference model |

## Phase I: Pilot Objectives (2026-2029)

### 2026: Foundation Year
- Publish [Broader Guidelines for Dark Sky Policy](internal:policy/recommendations#broader-guidelines) under existing environmental authority
- Constitute [Steering Committee](internal:policy/recommendations#steering-committee) chaired by Chief Secretary
- Amend [Maharashtra Tourism Policy 2024](internal:policy/recommendations#tourism-policy) to integrate astrotourism
- Launch pilot projects at eleven sites across the state

### 2027: Regulatory Development
- Finalize area classifications: core dark, buffer, and regulated urban areas
- Draft and notify ALAN under Maharashtra Environment Act
- Begin pilot site lighting retrofits and monitoring

### 2028-2029: Evidence Collection & Policy Finalization
- Build capacity across all stakeholder groups
- Systematically track pilot outcomes across four domains:
  - **Ecological**: Biodiversity response to darkness restoration
  - **Energy**: Consumption reduction and cost savings
  - **Health**: Public safety perception and community acceptance
  - **Economic**: Tourism revenue and job creation
- Incorporate findings into final ALAN notification ready for 2029 statewide deployment

## Institutional Framework

**[Steering Committee](internal:policy/recommendations#steering-committee)**:
- **Chair**: Chief Secretary, Government of Maharashtra
- **Members**: Principal Secretaries from Environment, Tourism, Forest, Urban Development, Energy, and Tribal Development
- **Technical Secretariat**: [AstronEra](internal:policy/recommendations#technical-secretariat)

The Steering Committee provides policy oversight, approves pilot site selection, reviews progress, and authorizes refinements based on evidence.

## Pilot Site Selection

Eleven pilot sites have been identified across Maharashtra to ensure policy applicability in diverse contexts:
- Protected Areas with high biodiversity value
- Coastal zones with turtle nesting sites (CRZ compliance)
- Agricultural and heritage tourism areas
- Urban and peri-urban municipal areas
- Tribal development areas

Specific site locations and classifications will be finalized during Phase I foundation year (2026).

## From Pilots to Statewide Policy

By 2029, Maharashtra will have:
- ✅ Validated technical standards proven feasible across diverse contexts
- ✅ Evidence-based economic case demonstrating :defn[ROI]{#roi} through energy savings and tourism revenue
- ✅ Institutional capacity with trained personnel and tested coordination mechanisms
- ✅ Final ALAN notification incorporating three years of pilot learnings
- ✅ Public acceptance demonstrated through stakeholder engagement

This evidence base enables confident scaling decisions, transforming Dark Sky Conservation from experimental policy to validated governance framework ready for statewide implementation.

  **The pilot program is not merely a trial—it is the evidence-generation mechanism that transforms Dark Sky Conservation from policy proposal into validated, scalable governance framework ready for Maharashtra's 358 :defn[Urban Local Bodies]{#ulb} and 50+ :defn[Protected Areas]{#protected-area}.**
