- Conduct Maharashtra-specific assessments (sky quality, economic potential, ecological impacts)
- Translate scientific findings into policy briefs, technical notes, and public-facing content

### 3. International Liaison

- Act as liaison between [DarkSky International](term:dsi), international experts, and the Government of Maharashtra
- Facilitate knowledge exchange with jurisdictions implementing similar policies (Italy, Austria, South Africa, New Zealand)
- Represent Maharashtra in international dark sky forums and working groups
- Enable access to global technical resources and certification expertise

### 4. Certification Coordination

- Coordinate Dark Sky Place certification processes within India
- Support pilot sites through application preparation, technical compliance, and ongoing management

### 5. Capacity Building

- Cultivate localised AstroGuides through structured training programs
- Build technical capacity within government departments (Environment, Tourism, Forest, Urban Development)
- Develop training modules for municipal officials, urban planners, and enforcement personnel
- Create educational resources for communities in pilot and buffer zones

### 6. Data Systems and Monitoring

- Establish and process night-sky quality, light pollution, and ecological impact datasets
- Deploy [Sky Quality Meters](term:sqm) and coordinate citizen science monitoring programs
- Develop standardised data collection protocols for statewide monitoring
- Maintain centralized data repository for policy evaluation and adaptive management

### 7. Technical Liaison and Coordination

- Act as technical liaison between research institutions ([IIT](term:iit), [IISER](term:iiser), [TIFR](term:tifr), [TERI](term:teri)), universities, and government departments
- Coordinate collaborative research on ALAN impacts specific to Maharashtra
- Facilitate institutional partnerships for long-term monitoring and evaluation
- Enable academic-policy integration through regular engagement mechanisms

### 8. Standards Interpretation and Implementation Support

- Interpret international lighting standards ([DSI](term:dsi), [CIE](term:cie)) for Maharashtra context

- Support [Urban Local Bodies](term:ulb) with lighting policy integration into development plans
- Provide technical review of [Lighting Management Plans](term:lmp) for major projects

## Governance Structure

### Formal Appointment

AstronEra will be appointed as Technical Secretariat through:

- **Memorandum of Understanding ([MoU](term:mou))** between Government of Maharashtra and AstronEra (AEII Pvt. Ltd.)
- Clear terms of reference defining deliverables, timelines, and reporting requirements
- Annual work plans approved by the Steering Committee
- Regular performance reviews and adaptive management

### Accountability Mechanisms

- **Reporting**: Quarterly progress reports to Steering Committee
- **Transparency**: Public disclosure of key findings, datasets, and policy recommendations

- **Independence**: Technical advice provided on evidence basis, with government retaining final decision authority

## Relationship with DarkSky International

::note
**Clarification on DSI Role**: DarkSky International (DSI) is a United States-based, non-governmental, non-profit organisation that functions as a global technical and standards reference body for responsible outdoor lighting and night-sky protection.

Its role in Maharashtra's framework is **limited to**:
- Providing internationally recognised technical criteria
- Certification protocols and standards
- Best-practice guidance and peer learning

**DSI does NOT**:
- Hold policy delegation or regulatory authority
- Control funding or budgets
- Make enforcement decisions

All policy decisions, enforcement powers, and institutional control remain **exclusively with the Government of Maharashtra**. AstronEra acts as the **interface** between international technical standards and state-level implementation.
