Maharashtra's current approach to [ALAN](term:alan) lacks regulatory oversight, creating legal exposure under enforceable national and international commitments. This page documents binding obligations that require the State to address light pollution impacts.

## Legal Obligations Matrix

The following table establishes Maharashtra's legal duty to regulate ALAN across three jurisdictional levels:

## International Commitments

### CMS Light Pollution Guidelines

India is a signatory to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). :cite[The CMS Light Pollution Guidelines, revised and expanded at COP14 (February 2024)]{#cms-2024-light-guidelines}, establish specific obligations for member states.

**Key Requirements**:

- **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Conduct species-specific assessments within 20km of affected migratory species habitat
- **Lighting Management Plans**: Develop site-specific plans using:
  - Shielded fixtures preventing upward light emission
  - Low-intensity lighting appropriate to task
  - Warm spectrum (<2,700K [CCT](term:cct))
  - Operational curfews during migration periods
- **[Protected Area](term:protected-area) Integration**: Apply controls in and around wildlife corridors, wetlands, coastal zones

::tip
**Maharashtra Application**: Applies to coastal turtle nesting sites (Ratnagiri, Raigad), bird migration corridors through Western Ghats, and bat habitats in Protected Areas.
::

### CMS Strategic Plan for Migratory Species (2024–2032)

The Samarkand Strategic Plan establishes light pollution as a recognised anthropogenic pressure requiring systematic mitigation.

**Target 7** (Goal 2): Reduce anthropogenic pressures to non-detrimental levels for migratory species and their habitats.

::tip
**Maharashtra Obligation**: Develop and implement measures to reduce ALAN impacts in areas used by migratory birds, marine turtles, and bats.
::

## National Law

### Wildlife Protection Act, 1972

:cite[The Wildlife (Protection) Act]{#india-1972-wildlife-act} provides the statutory foundation for ALAN regulation in areas affecting protected species.

**Section 9**: Prohibits hunting and willful disturbance of Schedule I species
**Section 39**: Wildlife as state property with enforceable harm provisions

**Schedule I Species Affected by ALAN in Maharashtra**:

- **Tigers**: Nocturnal behavior disruption in tiger reserves
- **Marine Turtles** (Olive Ridley): Hatchling disorientation at nesting beaches
- **Bats**: Multiple species with disrupted foraging and navigation

**Legal Basis**: ALAN-related mortality or disturbance constitutes enforceable harm under existing provisions. No new legislation required.

### National Green Tribunal Directive (2024)

:cite[In OA 1380/2024 (Panchtattva Foundation vs. MoEFCC)]{#ngt-2024-alan-case}, the National Green Tribunal directed CPCB and MoEFCC to:

- Formally recognise ALAN as a pollutant with adverse ecological and health effects
- Formulate statutory framework for ALAN regulation
- Establish national lighting standards

**Status**: Case ongoing as of January 2026; no final standards formulated yet.

::tip
**Maharashtra Implication**: While national standards are pending, state-level action is permissible and advisable under existing environmental authority. Early adoption positions Maharashtra as national reference model.
::

### Marine Turtle Conservation

Two frameworks create binding obligations for coastal lighting:

**National Marine Turtle Action Plan (2021–2026)**:

- **Objective 2, Action 2.1**: "Manage and regulate artificial lighting in turtle nesting areas"
- Applies to Ratnagiri and Raigad districts (major Olive Ridley nesting sites)

**CRZ Notification 2019**:

- **Annexe I, Section 1.5**: Prohibits "pollution including lighting and sound" in and around turtle nesting grounds
- Legally binding under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
- Violation enforceable as environmental offense

::warning
**Current Compliance Status**: **Non-compliant**. Maharashtra lacks lighting restrictions at documented turtle nesting beaches.
::

### National Action Plan for Migratory Birds (2018–2023)

Though expired, the Action Plan establishes precedent for lighting controls:

**Action 1.6**: "Evaluate and mitigate impacts of night lighting on migrating birds"
**Action 2.5**: "Integrate lighting controls into Protected Area Management Plans"

::tip
**Maharashtra Application**: Relevant to Western Ghats bird corridors, coastal wetlands (flamingo habitat), and urban building collision hotspots.
::

## State Policy Alignment

While not creating legal obligations, state policies demonstrate existing commitment to objectives that ALAN regulation supports.

### AMRUT Climate Action Plans

:cite[43 Maharashtra cities have mandatory Climate Action Cells and city-level climate action plans (GR 2024)]{#maharashtra-2024-amrut-gr}.

::note
**ALAN Relevance**: Outdoor lighting efficiency and operational controls contribute to:

- Electricity demand reduction (Climate Mitigation)
- Urban heat island mitigation (Climate Adaptation)
- GHG emissions reduction (Net Zero pathway)

**Integration Pathway**: ALAN standards can be incorporated into existing AMRUT climate action framework without new administrative structure.
::

### India Net Zero 2070

:cite[India's Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS)]{#india-2022-net-zero} establishes pathway to net zero by 2070.

::note
**ALAN Contribution**: Outdoor lighting accounts for estimated 5% of global GHG emissions. Maharashtra's lighting efficiency improvements directly support national mitigation targets.
::

### Under2 Coalition

:cite[Maharashtra joined the Under2 Coalition in 2021]{#maharashtra-under2-coalition}, committing to Paris-aligned subnational climate action.

::note
**ALAN Alignment**: Responsible outdoor lighting demonstrates climate leadership and enables international peer learning with other coalition members implementing similar policies.
::

### SAPCCHH Maharashtra

:cite[State Action Plan on Climate Change and Human Health]{#sapcchh-2024-maharashtra} addresses environmental determinants of health.

::note
**ALAN Relevance**: [Circadian rhythm](term:circadian-rhythm) disruption and [melatonin suppression](term:melatonin-suppression) from nighttime light exposure create measurable health burdens. ALAN regulation supports public health objectives.
::

## Legal Risk Assessment

### Current Exposure

Maharashtra faces legal exposure on three fronts:

1. **CMS Non-Compliance**: Failure to implement Light Pollution Guidelines at migratory species sites creates potential CMS reporting obligations and international scrutiny
2. **CRZ Violation**: Unregulated lighting at turtle nesting beaches violates binding CRZ Notification, enforceable under Environment Act
3. **Wildlife Act Liability**: ALAN-caused disturbance or mortality of Schedule I species (tigers, turtles, bats) creates enforceable harm under existing provisions

### Compliance Pathway

**Immediate Actions** (0-12 months):

- Issue interim guidelines for coastal lighting under CRZ authority
- Integrate ALAN controls into Protected Area Management Plans
- Conduct baseline EIA at turtle nesting sites

**Medium-Term Actions** (12-24 months):

- Notify ALAN under Maharashtra Environment Protection Act
- Adopt technical standards aligned with CMS Guidelines
- Establish monitoring and enforcement mechanisms

**Long-Term Actions** (24-36 months):

- Statewide rollout of lighting standards
- Integration with EIA process for all major projects
- Compliance reporting to CMS and national frameworks

## Opportunities in Obligations

These legal obligations create **strategic advantages**:

1. **Budgetary Justification**: Compliance imperatives support resource allocation requests
2. **Inter-Departmental Coordination**: Shared legal duties facilitate collaboration
3. **National Leadership**: Early adoption positions Maharashtra as policy innovator
4. **International Recognition**: CMS compliance enhances state's environmental credentials
