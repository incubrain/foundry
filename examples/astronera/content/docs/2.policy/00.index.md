::callout{color="info"}
This section provides the legal foundation and regulatory models for Dark Sky Conservation. It outlines Maharashtra's existing obligations and proposes a phased regulatory framework.
::

## Why Maharashtra Has Legal Authority (and Obligation) to Act

Maharashtra's authority to regulate light pollution derives from multiple binding legal sources:

1. **International Treaties**: :defn[CMS]{#cms} Light Pollution Guidelines (India is signatory)
2. **National Law**: [Wildlife Protection Act 1972](internal:policy/legal-obligations#national), :defn[NGT]{#ngt} Directive 2024
3. **State Policy**: :defn[SAPCCHH]{#sapcchh} (State Action Plan on Climate Change and Human Health), climate action commitments

These obligations are not optional. They create enforceable duties for the State to address :defn[ALAN]{#alan} impacts on biodiversity, public health, and climate.

## What Other Jurisdictions Have Done

Over 40 jurisdictions worldwide have enacted Dark Sky legislation, providing replicable models. Maharashtra can adopt tested frameworks and leverage two decades of international regulatory experience.

| Model Type | Examples | Key Feature | Applicability to Maharashtra |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Explicit National Law | Croatia, France, Chile | Comprehensive ALAN regulation | High, supports state regulation |
| Regional Ordinances | Italy, Austria | Local control with state oversight | High, aligns with district implementation |
| Sector-Specific | Spain, Germany | Tourism and heritage focus | High, pilot site approach |
| Integrated Policy | South Africa, New Zealand | Astrotourism-led governance | High, economic development linkage |

## Proposed Regulatory Pathway for Maharashtra

Maharashtra adopts a pilot-informed policy approach:

1. **Steering Committee Formation**: Inter-departmental coordination body
2. **Broader Guidelines Publication**: Interim standards under existing environmental authority
3. **ALAN Notification**: Formal notification under Maharashtra Environment Protection Act
4. **Pilot Site Implementation**: Test regulations in diverse zone types
5. **Policy Refinement**: Revise based on pilot findings
6. **Statewide Rollout**: Scale proven frameworks across Maharashtra

This pathway manages risk while delivering early returns. Pilots validate regulatory models before statewide deployment.

## Department-Specific Actions

Each Maharashtra department has specific roles and responsibilities for Dark Sky Conservation:

| Department | Primary Responsibilities | Key Output |
|------------|-------------------------|------------|
| **Environment** | Lead agency, notification drafting, EIA integration | ALAN Notification |
| **Tourism** | Pilot site development, astrotourism promotion, AstroGuide training | 11 Dark Sky Certified sites |
| **Energy** | Lighting retrofits, efficiency standards, grid integration | 30% energy reduction |
| **Forest** | Protected area management, wildlife monitoring | Protected Area Management Plans |
| **Urban Development** | Municipal lighting guidelines, building codes | Model Lighting Ordinance |
| **Public Works** | Compliant fixture procurement, retrofits | Procurement Standards |
| **Law & Judiciary** | Legal framework review, enforcement mechanisms | Enforcement Regulations |
| **Finance** | Budget allocation, ROI modeling, revenue tracking | Budget Line Item |

## Why This Matters

**Legal Compliance**: Maharashtra faces legal exposure under Wildlife Protection Act, CMS obligations, and NGT directives. ALAN regulation addresses these binding requirements.

**Economic Opportunity**: Dark Sky certification delivers proven tourism multipliers, energy savings, and asset protection. Conservative ROI estimates show positive returns within 3 years.

**Climate Alignment**: Outdoor lighting efficiency contributes to Net Zero 2070 commitments and Under2 Coalition targets.

**National Leadership**: First-mover advantage positions Maharashtra as India's reference model for sustainable lighting governance.

## Next Steps

1. Review [Legal Obligations](internal:policy/legal-obligations) to understand compliance imperatives
2. Examine [Global Precedents](internal:policy/global-precedents) for tested regulatory models
3. Study [Department Actions](internal:policy/department-actions) to identify departmental roles
4. Read [Recommendations](internal:policy/recommendations) for immediate executable actions

The regulatory pathway is clear, tested, and low-risk. Maharashtra has authority, obligation, and opportunity to act.
