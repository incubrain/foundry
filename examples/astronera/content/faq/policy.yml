  - label: What is TARA?
    content:
      Trans-departmental Authority for Regulated ALAN (Artificial Light at
      Night). Maharashtra's coordinating mechanism bringing Environment,
      Tourism, Forest, Urban Development, and Energy departments under unified
      lighting regulation framework.

  - label: Why does Maharashtra need dark sky policy?
    content:
      Legal mandate (EPA 1986, Under2 Coalition, Net Zero 2070), economic
      leakage (₹20-25M tons CO2/year from inefficient lighting), ecological
      damage (60% invertebrates nocturnal), public health (circadian
      disruption), and tourism revenue opportunity ($1B → $3B market 2025-2032).

  - label: How is this different from energy efficiency programs?
    content:
      Energy efficiency focuses on consumption reduction. Dark sky policy
      addresses light pollution holistically - direction, spectrum, intensity,
      timing. This includes shielding, CCT limits, curfews, and ecological
      sensitivity zones. Achieves 30-70% savings beyond standard efficiency
      measures.

  - label: What is the implementation timeline?
    content:
      Phase 1 (2025-2026) - 6 priority certification sites, regulatory framework
      adoption. Phase 2 (2027-2028) - District-level rollout, enforcement
      mechanisms. Phase 3 (2029-2030) - Full state compliance, measurable
      outcomes on energy, ecology, tourism.

  - label: Who enforces the policy?
    content:
      TARA coordinates enforcement through existing departmental authorities.
      Environment dept for pollution compliance, Urban Development for municipal
      lighting codes, Forest for protected areas, Tourism for certification
      sites. AstronEra provides technical secretariat support.

  - label: Does this affect private property?
    content:
      Policy focuses on public lighting and commercial outdoor illumination.
      Private residential lighting encouraged but not mandated to follow
      guidelines. Commercial properties in ecologically sensitive zones or
      certification sites subject to regulation.
