  - label: What is ALAN and why regulate it?
    content:
      Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) is scientifically established pollutant
      affecting ecosystems, human health, and energy efficiency. EPA 1986
      includes light under pollution definition. Regulation required for legal
      compliance, not optional environmental initiative.

  - label: What are the lighting standards?
    content:
      'CCT (Correlated Color Temperature) ≤3000K for all outdoor lighting,
      full-cutoff fixtures (0 lumens above horizontal), dimming/curfew 11pm-5am
      in sensitive zones, lux limits based on zone classification (residential:
      5-10 lux, commercial: 10-20 lux, ecological: <1 lux).'

  - label: What is Sky Quality Meter (SQM)?
    content:
      Handheld device measuring sky brightness in magnitudes per square
      arcsecond (mag/arcsec²). Urban areas typically 17-19, suburban 19-21, dark
      sky sites >21. Higher number = darker sky = less light pollution. Used for
      baseline assessment and ongoing monitoring.

  - label: How do you measure lighting compliance?
    content:
      Combination of fixture inventory (shielding, CCT verification),
      illuminance measurements (lux meters), sky quality monitoring (SQM
      readings at fixed points), spectral analysis (blue light content), and
      before/after satellite imagery (VIIRS/DNB data).

  - label: What retrofitting is required?
    content:
      Replace unshielded fixtures with full-cutoff alternatives, swap cool white
      (>4000K) to warm white (≤3000K) LEDs, install dimmers/timers for adaptive
      lighting, remove unnecessary fixtures, redirect sports/commercial lights
      away from sky. 90% achievable through fixture replacement, not full
      infrastructure overhaul.

  - label: Can we use existing LED infrastructure?
    content:
      Partially. Modern LED fixtures can be retrofitted with warmer CCT modules
      and shielding attachments. Older installations require replacement.
      Dimming capability essential - most municipal LEDs already support this
      through controller upgrades. Average 60-70% of existing infrastructure
      adaptable.

  - label: How do we avoid blue light without losing visibility?
    content:
      '3000K warm white LEDs provide excellent visibility (mesopic vision
      optimized) while reducing blue content 60-70% vs 5000K cool white. Human
      eye adapts within 15 minutes. Safety studies show no increase in
      accidents/crime with warm white street lighting.'

  - label: What about security and safety concerns?
    content:
      Dark sky compliant lighting improves security - reduces glare (better
      facial recognition), eliminates harsh shadows (hiding spots), maintains
      night vision adaptation. Police data from certified sites shows no
      increase in crime. Safety = proper illumination of ground, not sky.
