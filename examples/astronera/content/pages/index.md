  quote: We are working with the State Government of Maharashtra and DarkSky
    International to create India's first comprehensive Dark Sky Conservation
    policy. This is not just about protecting astronomical heritage—it's about
    protecting public health, biodiversity, and our climate future. The night sky
    is not a lost heritage; it is a recoverable public asset. **The decision point
    is now.**
