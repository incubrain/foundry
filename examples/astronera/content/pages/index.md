  What is Light Pollution?

  #description
  Light pollution, commonly referred to as Artificial Light at Night (ALAN), is the human-made alteration of natural nighttime lighting that disrupts the balance of the night environment. It is the excessive or misdirected use of artificial outdoor lighting that disrupts natural darkness through upward or outward light emission beyond what is necessary for human safety and functionality. Left unchecked, it affects [human health](internal\:research/health), [biodiversity](internal\:research/ecology), [energy systems](internal\:research/climate), and [climate](internal\:research/climate). It manifests in six distinct forms:

The Cost of Unregulated Light

#description
Maharashtra can convert wasted lighting into economic opportunity currently lost to inefficiency. **[Dark sky tourism](internal\:research/tourism)** **generates USD 1–3 billion globally**, with **certified regions reporting 30–40 % growth in visitors**. **International evidence shows dark sky-compliant lighting delivers returns of approximately 1.9×**, through energy savings, reduced maintenance, and sustained astrotourism value.

Ecosystems Under Artificial Light

#description
Artificial light at night is disrupting ecosystems across Maharashtra, from forests and farmlands to rivers and coastlines. **With over 60 % of species globally dependent on natural darkness**, skyglow, glare, and light trespass are accelerating biodiversity loss while **quietly undermining agriculture, fisheries, and long-term ecological resilience**.

Circadian Disruption at Scale

#description
Artificial light at night suppresses melatonin and disrupts circadian rhythms essential to human health. **Chronic exposure is linked to elevated cardiovascular risk, metabolic disorders, and up to 2.5× higher dementia risk**, positioning light pollution as a **population-scale public health concern**, particularly in urban and industrial regions.

Energy Waste and Emissions

#description
Outdoor lighting represents a significant and under-regulated source of energy waste. **Lighting contributes approximately 5 % of global** greenhouse gas **emissions**, while Maharashtra's extensive urban and industrial lighting footprint places **millions of tons of avoidable CO₂ emissions within direct public-infrastructure governance**.

  AstronEra's work is grounded in the belief that dark skies are not a luxury or a nostalgia project, but a matter of public interest. Through research, policy design, and internationally benchmarked frameworks, we are working to support Maharashtra in addressing light pollution as a public health, biodiversity, and climate concern.

  The night sky is not a lost heritage. It is a recoverable public asset. The opportunity lies in acting early, designing systems carefully, and ensuring that protection and development move forward together.
