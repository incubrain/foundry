  What is Light Pollution?

  #description
  Light pollution, caused by excessive or misdirected Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) that spills upward or outward beyond what is needed for safety and functional use, disturbs the balance of the natural night environment. Left unchecked, it affects [human health](internal\:research/health), [biodiversity](internal\:research/ecology), [energy systems](internal\:research/climate), and [climate](internal\:research/climate). It manifests in six distinct forms:

The Cost of Unregulated Light

#description
Maharashtra can turn wasted lighting into economic opportunity. Dark sky tourism generates USD 1–3 B globally, with certified regions seeing 30–40 % visitor growth. Dark sky–compliant lighting delivers ~190% returns via energy savings, lower maintenance, and sustained astrotourism.

Ecosystems Under Artificial Light

#description
Artificial light at night disrupts ecosystems across Maharashtra, from forests and farms to rivers and coasts. With over 60% of species globally reliant on natural darkness, light pollution accelerates biodiversity loss and quietly undermines agriculture, fisheries, and ecological resilience.

Circadian Disruption at Scale

#description
ALAN suppresses melatonin and disrupts circadian rhythms. Chronic exposure is linked to elevated cardiovascular risk, metabolic disorders, and up to **2.5× higher dementia risk**, positioning light pollution as a **global health concern.**

Energy Waste and Emissions

#description
Outdoor lighting is a major, under-regulated source of energy waste. Lighting contributes ~5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and Maharashtra's urban and industrial footprint produces millions of tons of avoidable CO₂ under public infrastructure governance.
