terms:
  - id: alan
    term: Artificial Light at Night
    abbreviation: ALAN
    definition:
      Light emitted outdoors during nighttime hours from artificial sources,
      disrupting natural darkness and ecological processes.
  - id: light-pollution
    term: Light Pollution
    definition:
      Excessive, misdirected, or obtrusive artificial light that alters natural
      light levels in outdoor environments.
  - id: sky-glow
    term: Sky Glow
    definition:
      Brightening of the night sky over inhabited areas caused by artificial
      light scattering in the atmosphere.
  - id: cct
    term: Correlated Color Temperature
    abbreviation: CCT
    definition:
      Measurement of light source color appearance in Kelvin (K), indicating
      whether light appears warm (2700K-3000K) or cool (4000K-6500K).
  - id: lumen
    term: Lumen
    definition:
      Unit of measurement for total quantity of visible light emitted by a
      source.
  - id: lux
    term: Lux
    definition:
      Unit of measurement for illuminance, representing one lumen per square
      meter at a surface.
  - id: uplight
    term: Uplight
    definition:
      Light emitted above the horizontal plane of a luminaire, contributing
      directly to sky glow.
  - id: full-cutoff-fixture
    term: Full Cutoff Fixture
    definition:
      Lighting fixture designed to emit zero light above 90 degrees from
      vertical, minimizing upward light spill and sky glow.
  - id: shielded-lighting
    term: Shielded Lighting
    definition:
      Lighting fixtures designed to prevent light emission above the horizontal
      plane.
  - id: sqm
    term: Sky Quality Meter
    abbreviation: SQM
    definition:
      Instrument for measuring night-sky brightness in magnitudes per square
      arcsecond.
  - id: led
    term: Light Emitting Diode
    abbreviation: LED
    definition:
      Semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it,
      widely used in energy-efficient lighting.
  - id: clutter
    term: Light Clutter
    definition:
      Excessive groupings of bright light sources creating visual confusion and
      distraction, often in dense urban commercial districts with competing signs
      and displays.
  - id: over-illumination
    term: Over-illumination
    definition:
      Lighting beyond what is functionally required, resulting in wasted energy
      and amplification of other light pollution effects, commonly seen in
      parking lots and large developments.
  - id: blue-light-hazard
    term: Blue Light Hazard
    definition:
      Damage caused by blue-rich artificial light, including circadian rhythm
      disruption, retinal stress, and increased risk of chronic health
      conditions, with documented impacts on wildlife behaviour and reproduction.
