  title: The Challenge
  icon: i-lucide-alert-circle
  color: error
  description: "50,000-year-old meteor impact crater with no lighting regulation. Sodium vapor streetlights, unshielded temple lighting, and increasing light trespass from surrounding villages. No technical capacity for sky quality monitoring or DSI application process."

  title: The Solution

  color: success
  description: "Comprehensive lighting inventory, SQM monitoring network, community AstroGuide training, phased retrofit plan with warm-white shielded fixtures, and coordinated DSI certification application. Now model site for Maharashtra's Dark Sky Policy."

### Why This Worked

1. **Technical Secretariat model reduces government burden** - We manage DSI liaison, documentation, and compliance tracking
2. **Community engagement creates local ownership** - AstroGuide training generates employment and stakeholder buy-in
3. **Phased retrofits manage costs** - Prioritize high-impact lighting zones; spread capital expense over 18-24 months
4. **Policy integration amplifies impact** - Site certification feeds into state-level ALAN regulation framework
5. **International credibility attracts funding** - DSI recognition unlocks green tourism grants and astrotourism investment
