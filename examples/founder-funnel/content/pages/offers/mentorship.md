You know how to code. You understand the tech. But you're stuck:

- **Building features nobody asked for** while the real work sits untouched
- **Paralyzed by perfectionism** that stops you from shipping anything
- **Drowning in advice** but no clear path forward
- **Wasting time on the wrong problems** because you don't have external perspective

Sound familiar? That's what 13 years of failed startups taught me before I figured it out.

## What You Actually Get

### 🧭 **Your Founder Compass** (1 Hour/Month)

A strategic planning session where we:
- Review what you shipped since last month (decisions log + product progress)
- Identify what's actually moving the needle vs busywork
- Plan the next 30 days with ruthless focus
- Course-correct before you waste weeks on dead ends

**Think of this as your external brain**—keeping you honest, focused, and building what matters.

### 📋 **Pre-Meeting Strategic Review**

Before each session, I review:
- Your product/offers/strategy changes
- Your decisions log (what you shipped and why)
- Where you're stuck or drifting

**You get 2x value**—my prep time means our live hour is pure execution, not catch-up.

### 💬 **Private Founder Community**

- Learn from other serious technical founders on the same path
- Direct DM access with priority response
- No fluff, no motivational BS—just builders helping builders ship

### 🚀 **Full-Spectrum Support**

From idea validation → first customer → profitable business:
- Ideation and market validation
- Product strategy and architecture decisions  
- Launch planning and go-to-market
- Growth and optimization once validated

### 🎁 **Founder Funnel Perks**

- **Priority template support**—stuck on implementation? Jump the queue
- **Free workshop access**—in-person in Pune or recorded sessions
- **IncuBrain SaaS beta access** (WIP)—complements Founder Funnel template

## Before You Book: The Work You Must Do

This isn't passive advice. You must show up prepared. Here's what's required:

### 📝 **Pre-Meeting Prep (Required 48hrs Before Session)**

1. **Decisions Log Update**
   - What did you ship since last session?
   - What decisions did you make and why?
   - What's blocking you right now?

2. **Current State Assessment**
   - Product status (link + demo if applicable)
   - Traffic/conversion metrics (if live)
   - Top 3 questions for the session

3. **Next 30-Day Plan Draft**
   - What are you committing to build?
   - What are you deliberately NOT doing?
   - What would success look like?

**Why this matters:** Prep work ensures our live time is execution-focused, not information gathering.

## Who This Is For

### ✅ **Good Fit:**
- Technical founders (3+ years dev experience)
- Stuck in perfectionist loops preventing shipping
- Have domain expertise but unclear on validation/GTM
- Want accountability and external perspective

- Expect passive advice without implementation
- Looking for motivational coaching vs tactical execution
- Not willing to do prep work or follow through

## What Makes This Different

Most mentorship is vague advice and motivational platitudes. This is different:

1. **Evidence-Based:** I review your decisions log, product, and metrics before we meet
2. **Action-Oriented:** Every session ends with clear next actions and 30-day plan
3. **Community-Driven:** Learn from other founders on the same path
4. **Founder-to-Founder:** I'm building alongside you, not theorizing from the sidelines

## The Founder Behind This

Hi, I'm Drew (Mac) MacGibbon. I've spent 13 years failing as a founder before figuring out what actually works.

**My failures taught me:**
- Don't build products nobody wants (lost $300k+ learning this)
- Validation before building (saved you months)
- Ship working solutions fast (perfection kills momentum)
- Focus beats features every time

**What I've built:**
- Founder Funnel (open-source validation template)
- IncuBrain (founder tools for systematic validation)
- Multiple failed startups (expensive education)

I'm not a guru. I'm a founder who finally figured it out—and I'm helping others skip my mistakes.

## FAQ

**Q: What if I'm not ready to ship yet?**  
A: Then you're not ready for mentorship. This is for founders ready to execute, not plan forever.

**Q: Can I skip the prep work?**  
A: No. If you skip prep, I'll reschedule. Prep work makes our live time 10x more valuable.

**Q: What if I don't have a product yet?**  
A: Perfect. We'll validate demand first, then build only if market proves it's worth building.

**Q: How do refunds work?**  
A: First session unsatisfied? Full refund, no questions asked. After that, monthly commitment.

**Q: Can I book one-off sessions?**  
A: No. Monthly commitment ensures continuity and accountability. One-offs don't create lasting change.
