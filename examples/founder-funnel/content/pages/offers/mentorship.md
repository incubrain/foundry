<!-- 3. CASE STUDY (PROOF) -->

## From Scattered Effort to $5M in Government Contracts
##### Shweta Kulkarni (CEO, Astronera) scaled 50x in 6 months by narrowing her focus

::case-study
---
client:
  name: Shweta Kulkarni
  role: Founder & CEO
  company: Astronera
  avatar: /team/shweta-avatar.jpg
  website: https://astronera.org

challenge: "Positioned as 'one-stop shop for astronomy' across India. Broad services, no differentiation, <$10K/year revenue. Scattered approach meant competing everywhere, winning nowhere."

solution: "Killed everything except Dark Sky conservation in Maharashtra. Strategic partnership with Dark Sky International. Top-down government approach. Lonar Crater as global proof point."

quote: "Mac helped us kill the 'do everything' approach. We went from <$10K/year to $5M in contracts. Hardest part was saying no to everything else. But that's what made room for this to work."

lessons:
  - text: "Focus beats breadth. One vertical done exceptionally well beats serving everyone poorly"
  - text: "Geography unlocks doors. Home state advantage (Maharashtra) opened government connections"
  - text: "Strategic partnerships amplify credibility. Dark Sky International opened institutional doors"
  - text: "Top-down beats bottom-up for big contracts. Government moves slow but writes massive checks"
  - text: "Proof point unlocked pipeline. Lonar Crater's global significance validated the entire approach"

<!-- 4. WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE -->
## What 90 Days Looks Like

Working with me, founders typically:

- **Kill 2-3 bad ideas** before wasting months building
- **Ship their first MVP** within 4-6 weeks (not 6 months)
- **Get their first paying customer** within 90 days
- **Gain clarity** on exact next actions vs endless planning
- **10x their output** by focusing ruthlessly and leveraging AI

## The Founder Behind This
::founder-bio
---
name: Mac
intro: "I'm Mac, a technical founder who spent 13 years failing before building profitable businesses. I write code, ship products, and help founders avoid the mistakes that cost me a decade."
avatar: /team/mac-avatar.jpg

sections:
  - title: "What I've Built"
    items:
      - "GitHub: 74 stars across open-source projects"
      - "Built and sold SaaS products"
      - "Profitable in 2025 after years of struggle"
      - "Now helping technical founders avoid my mistakes"
  
  - title: "Why This Works (Not Another Business Coach)"
    items:
      - "I write code. No corporate fluff, just tactical execution."
      - "I won't sugarcoat: some ideas deserve to die quickly"
      - "You don't need to explain technical tradeoffs to me"
      - "I understand 'just ship it' vs 'build it right'"

      - "I'm selective: I only work with founders I believe in"
  
  - title: "My Approach"
    items:
      - "Brutally honest (your idea might suck, and I'll tell you)"
      - "Ship-first mentality (done > perfect)"
      - "If I don't think I can help you, I'll say so in the consultation call"
      - "If you're not ready to ship, I'll push you anyway"
      - "Results-focused (revenue, customers, traction—not vanity metrics)"
